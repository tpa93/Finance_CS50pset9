# CS50 problem set week 9 - python flask
This repository shows my implementation of the related problem set.

During week 9 in CS50 the problem set given was to create an web application with html, css, jinja and python/flask.
With this web application following features should be simplified possible:
1. register new user
2. login
3. check stock quotes
4. "buy" and "sell" stocks
5. view transaction history
6. view user stock depot
7. logout

Given by the course was the following base structur of the project:
- 3 templates (apology.html, layout.html, login.html) 
- app.py containing only the implemented login route method, the base structure and all other empty route methods
- finance.db with only one table for users
- helpers.py
- requirements.txt

The implementation of the features mentioned above were up to the participant.
Feel free to explore my implementation. I#m open for any feedback.
